# Material Design Lite

Google's [Material Design Specification](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) defines a visual language for application design that has seen growing adoption in both mobile and web domains through the Android Design Support Library, and the Polymer Paper-Elements implementation.

The [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/index.html) implementation released in July 2015 allows developers to add Material Design aesthetics to their websites and applications using vanilla JavaScript and CSS (without requiring dependency on any 3rd party app frameworks) and in a manner suitable for cross-platform development.

The _nitya:mdl_ package is meant to simply package up the Material Design Lite distribution for use with Meteor. Over time, the package may be updated to offer additional features that build on mdl.

# Version
The _nitya:mdl_ package version will reflect the version of the underlying Material Design Lite distribution, which is currently (on July 7, 2015) at v1.0.0
