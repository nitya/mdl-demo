# Material Design Lite Demo

Demo of the nitya:mdl package which simply packages up the [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/) or MDL distribution 
for use with Meteor applications.

## Usage

### Add the Material Design Package
```
meteor add nitya:mdl
```

### Link Style dependencies
In your app html file, add links to any specific fonts you might use (with MD aesthetic).
The demo shows examples of the Material Design icons font and the Roboto font.

### Leverage Templates
MDL supports standard templates (complete layouts with views) for popular app requirements. Start with one of 
those [templates](http://www.getmdl.io/templates/index.html) or build your own templates up from basic 
MDL [components](http://www.getmdl.io/components/index.html)
